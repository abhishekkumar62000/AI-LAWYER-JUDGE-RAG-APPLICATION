━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR PERFORMANCE: 7.5/10

⭐ STRENGTHS:
  ✅ Strong opening statement with compelling facts
  ✅ Correctly cited Section 437 CrPC
  ✅ Addressed judge's concern about CCTV

⚠️ IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
  ❌ Did not mention Manish Garg judgment
     (key precedent for bail in false implication cases)
  ❌ Should have explained why witness is credible
  ❌ Time management: Used 4:23 out of 15 available

🎯 BENCH'S VIEW:
  "Your argument is solid, but you missed the landmark 
  Manish Garg case (2015 SCC 623) where Supreme Court
